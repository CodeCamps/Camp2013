{"name":"Camp2013","tagline":"Landry Academy Game Programming Camp, June 2013","body":"Yet another fun-filled and exhausting week at Landry Academy’s Game Programming Camp 2013. We had five students, none of whom had used a compiler before this class.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, I typically have a brainstorming session with the students while the tools are installing. With past classes, we compile a list of game genres that we might like to explore, come to a consensus on which to implement, then dive deeper into the details of the selected game.\r\n\r\nThis year, the students gravitated immediately to a concept based loosely on Temple Run. Rather than considering other genres, they kept tossing out ideas for the platformer-style game. It was obvious what our project would be early into the process. I keep campaigning for a Rock Band clone, but it never seemed to take hold of anyone’s interest.\r\n\r\n![The Students](/images/Camp2013/students.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis year, in addition to art I created and images we scavenged from the web, we took video of one of the camp counselors in several poses, including a slow motion roll. The students cut the images from the still frames of the video, and the counselor (hi, Tim!) was our game’s main character.\r\n\r\n![Super Tim](/images/Camp2013/sprites.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe game supports two players, each of which has to run an identical gauntlet of obstacles. The player that makes it the furthest distance before losing three health points is the winner.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, the students learned about how simple, manageable components of a game are implemented, and how those simpler parts combine to make a more-complex whole. They also learned about the tools that game developers use to create games, and how to trim and prioritize an overly ambitious design to meet a looming deadline.\r\n\r\nThe original design included power-ups and more elaborate obstacles. In the end, we realized that the full game would to be too much work for a week-long project. We cut features, but the end result was still a very nice game.\r\n\r\n[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm6kNZeW9Pw) of the game that the class made.","google":"UA-3294285-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
